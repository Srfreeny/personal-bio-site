      Hi there! My name is Stephen Freeny and I'm working towards obtaining the skills to be a kick-butt Fullstack Developer. I come from a background of service industry jobs from High-School through College, followed by a year of work at UPS. From there I got the opportunity to join a growing third-party logistics company by the name of Cavalry Logistics. I worked there for 5 years in almost all departments. Working there taught me alot about the transportation industry as well as skills in conflict resolution and negotiation. Through the crazy world of transportation I gained alot of confidence in my ability to grow and adapt no matter the situation. I've got many crazy stories I could tell you. I eventually came to realize though, that the business world wasn't for me. I had a friend teach himself coding, and he encouraged me to give it a try. A short time later I quit my current job, just before a global pandemic, and suddenly gained alot of time to myself. I took a jumpstart course and the rest is history. I immediately applied to NSS. A short time later I got the privilege of being accepted to Evening Cohort 13, the "Lucky 13". This will get updated as we go along and by the end of this course. I'm confident I'll be the type of developer your company needs.
